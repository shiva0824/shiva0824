## Hi there I'm Shiva Prasad ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Clarkson University (Dec 2025), passionate about Machine Learning, MLOps, and Cloud Engineering, and Iâ€™m currently focused on building real-world projects using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS, and MLflow.  

Ignore some of my earlier repositories, they were created during my initial learning phase. Theyâ€™re simple, experimental, and part of my foundation, but youâ€™re welcome to explore them for a nostalgic peek into how my learning journey began.
